This version contains provider upgrade to 2.46 and removal of "provider" from modules. Also added data.aws_ami owners when searching for AMI on AWS (now required).

## Provider Upgrade

### Issue

Update provider version as latest available version.

### Change

Updated tests to use provider 2.46

#### How to upgrade provider

Change provider required version on infra terraform code to 2.46:

```hcl-terraform
provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-1"
  version = "2.46.0"
}
```

To be sure, remove .terraform directory and re-run `terraform init`


## Provider removal

Provider AWS declaration has been removed from modules. This is a best practice and also permits the usage of the modules when working with aws subaccounts.

## aws_ami owners

The Provider update caused the introduction of a new variable in the "data.aws_ami" resource used by the modules.
                  
The default variables have been set with the ids of the accounts that hold the default AMI, in case the AMI used are not the default ones, it will be necessary to populate the corresponding inputs of the modules with the correct value.

Example for aws-kubernetes module:

```hcl-terraform
...
  kube-master-ami-owner = "363601582189"
  kube-master-ami       = "KFD-Ubuntu-Master-1.15.5-1-1582820289"
  kube-master-count     = 3
  kube-master-type      = "t3.large"
...
```

## Module aws-vpc internal-zone intput change

To increase readability on `aws-vpc` module, internal-zone input has been changed from:

```hcl-terraform
  name = "${var.env}.${var.name}.${var.internal-zone}"
```

to 

```hcl-terraform
  name = "${var.internal-zone}"
```

this way the internal domain is not calculated from `env` and `name` variables

### How to upgrade aws-vpc module 

To upgrade, you need to change only the internal-zone input, matching the old domain generated from `"${var.env}.${var.name}.${var.internal-zone}"` .

## Autoscaling groups with Cluster Autoscaler

Added on all autoscaling group the possibility to set min max and desired. You can also use count to have min max and desired set to the same values:

```hcl-terraform
kube-workers = [
    {
      kind     = "infra"
      min      = 3
      desired  = 3
      max      = 3
      type     = "t3.large"
      kube-ami = "KFD-Ubuntu-Node-1.15.5-1-1582820290"
    },
    {
      kind     = "app"
      min      = 1
      desired  = 3
      max      = 5
      type     = "t3.medium"
      kube-ami = "KFD-Ubuntu-Node-1.15.5-1-1582820290"
    },
  ]
```

Added tags on autoscaling group with the node type to let cluster autoscaler scale up from 0 and to 0:

```hcl-terraform
...
    {
      key                 = "k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/node-template/label/node-kind.sighup.io/${lookup(var.kube-workers[count.index], "kind")}"
      value               = ""
      propagate_at_launch = "true"
    },
...
```

### Install cluster autoscaler

Add katalog on Furyfile.yml and follow the docs: [Cluster Autoscaler Docs](../../katalog/clusterautoscaler/README.md)   


## Spot autoscaling groups

To add a spot autoscaling group to the cluster, another map is needed in the `aws-kubernetes` module, `kube-workers-spot`. The usage is the same of kube-workers but you need to set also a secondary instance type:

```hcl-terraform
kube-workers-spot = [
    {
      kind           = "job"
      min            = 0
      desired        = 0
      max            = 1
      type           = "t3.small"
      type_secondary = "t3a.small"
      kube-ami       = "KFD-Ubuntu-Node-1.15.5-1-1582820290"
    },
  ]
```

# Release notes

This version replaces the bash logic for the auto-join feature with the one implemented in golang (furyagent).

## Master nodes load balancer issue

### Use case

Having a cluster with the auto-join feature enable, this improves the way a node joins a cluster.


### Change

You have to setup the new image name in the worker pool with the auto-join feature enable.

#### How to deploy it

##### Requirements

Having version 1.15.4 deployed, change the version to 1.15.5-1 in your `Furyfile.yml`, then:

```bash
$ furyctl install
```

This command downloads the patch in your `vendor/modules/aws/aws-kubernetes` directory.


##### Before deploy

You can check terraform plans before applying the new configuration.

```bash
$ terraform plan
```

##### Applying it

If everything is fine with the terraform plan, we are ready to go!

```bash
$ terraform apply -auto-approve
```

The change in master nodes are automatically while worker nodes needs to be destroyed and recreated.

##### Verify

Check if the the launch configuration contains the new AMI id from the ec2 console.

## New packages: Welcome EBS CSI Driver and AWS Load Balancer Controller! 📕

This release adds two new packages, `ebs-csi-driver` and `load-balancer-controller`. The first one is a mandatory package to use EBS volumes in your EKS cluster, since from EKS version 1.23 the in-tree EBS volume plugin is deprecated.
The second one is the official AWS controller to manage AWS Load Balancers, which is a mandatory package to use all the features provided from AWS on the Load Balancers, for example, enabling the proxy protocol on Network Load Balancers.

## Removals: Removed all the legacy terraform modules to install Kubernetes on EC2 🚮

This release completely removes all the terraform modules used for the installation of a Kubernetes cluster using EC2. Kubernetes Fury Distribution has deprecated support for EC2-based clusters in favour of EKS (managed) clusters.

## Update Guide 🦮

There is no update guide since this release completeley changes the scope of this module, from a colleciton of packages to install a Kubernetes cluster on AWS to a collection of packages to install on top of an existing Kubernetes EKS/AWS cluster.

## Breaking Changes 🚨

In this release, the **Snapshot Controller** has been migrated from **Katalog** (Kubernetes manifests managed with Kustomize) to **AWS EKS Addon** (using Terraform modules).

### 🔑 Key Changes

- The **Snapshot Controller** is no longer deployed using Kustomize within Katalog.
- Instead, it is now managed as an **AWS EKS Addon**, simplifying lifecycle management and ensuring better integration with AWS services.
- This change improves maintainability, reduces manual updates, and leverages AWS-managed updates for security and stability.

### ⚠️ Impact & Considerations

- Existing snapshot functionality should remain unaffected.
- Users should ensure that the **AWS EKS Addon** for the Snapshot Controller is enabled in their cluster.
- If any custom configurations were applied via Kustomize, they should be reviewed and adapted to the AWS EKS Addon settings.

## Update Guide 🛠️

Delete the existing snapshot-controller:

```shell
kustomize build katalog/snapshot-controller | kubectl delete -f -
```

Apply the updated terraform module included in this release.

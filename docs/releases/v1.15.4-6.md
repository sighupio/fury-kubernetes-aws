This version contains a patch in the [`aws-kubernetes` terraform module](modules/aws-kubernetes) that fixes a problem
related to Calico CNI (again).

## Calico

### Use case

Fury Kubernetes Cluster Using calico from fury-kubernetes-networking.

### Issue

Calico requires to have disabled the src/dst check. 
Documented here: https://docs.projectcalico.org/v2.3/reference/public-cloud/aws

### Change

#### How to deploy it

##### Requirements

Having version 1.15.4 deployed, change the version to 1.15.4-6 in your `Furyfile.yml`, then:

```bash
$ furyctl install
```

This command downloads the patch in your `vendor/modules/aws/aws-kubernetes` directory.

##### Before deploy

You can check terraform plans before applying the new configuration.

```bash
$ terraform plan
```

##### Applying it

If everything is fine with the terraform plan, we are ready to go!
